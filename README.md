**1. Requirements**

This is *One Person Project* made by me. So the requirements were a Laptop with good processor. An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) to write a source code. I personally
use VScode to write my programs.

**2. Design**

I take inspiration form X-ToDo ([https://todo-app-xstate-react.netlify.app/](url)) app for my design and upgraded some features init.


**3. Implementation**

This app cade is written with semantic HTML 5 using CSS 3 to add some style. I also used  explicit technologies (they were discribed below) to achieve a good UX design.

**4. Verification**

~~No verification is required in this project~~

 
**5. Maintenance**

As it is a SPA (Single Page Application),  maintenance of this app is done with Debuggers. Public reviews also helps to find bugs in application.
